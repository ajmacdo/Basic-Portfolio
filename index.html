        <p>Lover of animals, nature, leisurely runs, and warm and cozy beverages. Collector of mugs and scarves, which feeds an internal struggle with my appreciation for minimalism and living sustainably. Meticulous and as eager to put my skills to work as I am to learn. Iâ€™m motivated by feeling positioned to see the results of my creative efforts in accomplishments for the whole team, and empowered by the trust and esteem of a team to which I mutually contribute positivity and moral support.
